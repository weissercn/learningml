Based on the article on https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html

This is an explanation how to create a repository that is installable by pip.

First you need a directory structure like this:

learningml/
	learningml/
		__init__.py
		text.py
	setup.py

in __init__.py put:
"
from .text import joke
"

in test.py put:

"
def joke():
	return ("This is a joke")

"

then put the following into setup.py

"
from setuptools import setup

setup(name='learningml',
      version='0.1',
      description='This repository demonstrates how to make a project pip installable, write a Python module in C++ and use scikit-learn, keras and spearmint.',
      url='https://github.com/weissercn/learningml',
      author='Constantin Weisser',
      author_email='weissercn@gmail.com',
      license='MIT',
      packages=['learningml'],
      zip_safe=False)
"

to install use:
python setup.py install


To publish on Pypi, create a source distribution and upload it do:
python setup.py register sdist upload

In order for people to install your code they should type:
pip install learningml
