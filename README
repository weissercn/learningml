This repository demonstrates how to make a project pip installable, write a Python module in C++ and use scikit-learn and keras for goodness of fit problems in an arbitrary number of dimensions.

In order to run some of the code, one has to define the bash variable learningml. In my case it is

export learningml="/Users/weisser/MIT_Dropbox/MIT/Research/learningml/learningml"

This has to be sourced.
