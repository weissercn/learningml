THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE RENAMED ML_GoF and investigates how to use ML in Goodness-of-fit problems in particle physics.

In order to run some of the code, one has to define the bash variable learningml. In my case it is

export learningml="/Users/weisser/MIT_Dropbox/MIT/Research/learningml/learningml"

This has to be sourced.
