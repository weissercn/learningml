gaussian_same_projection_on_each_axis_explained:


We want to sample from a D dimensional gaussian that has the same standard deviation in all directions except for one. 

This direction is specified to make a 45 degree angle to all positive coordinate axes (x,y,z,...). The corresponding vector is (1,1,...,1). 

In practice we sample from a gaussian of standard deviation $\sigma_{parallel}$ and mean $loc\_centre \times sqrt(no\_dim)$ once and from a gaussian of standard deviation $\sigma_{perp}$ and mean 0 (D-1) times. 

Then, a coordinate transformation needs to be made into our original (x,y,z,... ) coordinates, to make the example closer to reality, which means harder. 

In a real high dimensional physics problem one would not know the perfect set of axes were in which analysing the problem would be easiest.
